## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a aspiring JS dev with some SysAdmin scars to prove Iâ€™ve been around tech a while.

**Stuff I Mess With:**  
JavaScript, React.js, Firebase, Git, Jest, Postman, Linux/UNIX, bash scriptingâ€”oh, and that janky Arduino security rig from my CV. Probably forgot some random thing, but thatâ€™s the gist. 

I learn by breaking stuff and fixing itâ€”my old i5-3470 homelab with a GTX 1070 for transcoding, 2nd LAN card for VLAN's/VPN setups and dying HDDs taught me that. Retired that beast â€˜cause ainâ€™t nobody got time for 24/7 babysitting anymore!

**Stats and Whatever:**  
Poke around my repos. Nothing too fancy yet, but Iâ€™m working on it.
