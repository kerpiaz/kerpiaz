## Hi there 👋

## I'm a aspiring JS dev with some SysAdmin scars to prove I’ve been around tech a while.

**Stuff I Mess With:**  
- **Coding**: JavaScript, React.js, Firebase  
- **Testing**: Git, Jest, Postman  
- **OS & Scripting**: Linux/UNIX, bash scripting  
- **Hardware**: That janky Arduino security rig from my CV, old story but we won 2nd place  
- **Homelab Setup**: VLANs/VPNs, transcoding tinkering, shared NAS and Syncthing  
- **Homelab Hardware**: Old i5-3470, GTX 1070, dying HDDs (retired that beast—24/7 upkeep and power costs wore me out!)
Probably forgot some random oddball, but that’s the gist.


**Stats and Whatever:**  
Poke around my repos. Nothing too fancy yet, but I’m working on it.
